# NexaLang

**Nexa** is a modern, multi-paradigm programming language designed for safety, expressiveness, and adaptability. It combines the safety of Rust, the simplicity of Python, and the concurrency of Erlang, with built-in support for AI-driven development and distributed systems. Whether you're building AI pipelines, cloud applications, or embedded systems, Nexa aims to empower developers with a unified, future-proof tool.

## Goals
- **Safety**: Compile-time memory and concurrency checks.
- **Expressiveness**: Intuitive syntax for rapid prototyping.
- **AI Integration**: Directives for AI-assisted optimization.
- **Distributed Systems**: Native actor model for scalability.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Suffix30/NexaLang.git`
2. Install Python 3.8+.
3. Run the interpreter: `python nexa_interpreter.py` with a `.nexa` file.

## Current Status
This is an early prototype with a Python-based interpreter supporting variables, functions, conditionals, and actors. Check the `examples/` folder for sample programs.
